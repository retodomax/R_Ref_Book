# Environments {#env}

## General properties

### Definition

* "Map" of the location of the functionâ€™s variables.
    - Objects of the enviromentent are stored somewhere in memory
    - Environment contains names and associated pointers to the place in memory
    - Contrary to lists, environments
        + contain always named entries
        + order does not matter
        + have enclosing environments
        + cannot be copied but only replaced
* Every object in R lives in an environment
* An Environment contains two things
    - Frame: collection of named objects
    - Enclosing environment/"Parent environment": reference to another environment


(ref:EnvDef) Environments consist of a frame containing pointers to objects and a pointer to the enclosing environment. The sequence of all pointers make up the search path.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:EnvDef)'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/env01_environment-structure.png")
```



```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
**parent environment &#8800; parent frame**: The enclosing environment is distinguished from the parent frame: the latter (returned by `parent.frame()`) refers to the environment of the caller of a function (call stack).
```




* `new.env()`: create new environment
* Access environment by name: `as.environment("package:stats")`
* Access namespaces by name: `asNamespace("stats")`
* Elements of enviornment can be accessed with `$`
* `parent.env()`: find enclosing environment
    - `parent.env<-` replacement function to change enclosing environment



### Attributes
* Name: new environemnts get hexadecimal names (location of the environment in memory). A name attribute can be added to have easier recognizable names.
    - get name with `environmentName()`
    - set name with `attr(x, "name") <- "Cool Name`


### Special environments
* `R_EmptyEnv`
    - Can be accessed with `emptyenv()`
    -  Only environment without an enclosing environment.
* `base`
    - Can be accessed with `baseenv()`
    - Environment of the base package
* `R_GlobalEnv`
    - Can be accessed with `globalenv()` or `.GlobalEnv`
    - Current environment when you start R
* Current/"local" environment
    - Can be accessed with `environment()` without argument.
    - Every time R runs an expression, it is run in one current environment
    - Value of variables defined in an expression are saved in memory and the pointer to that memory is saved in the current environment


### Search path and search list
* List of environments in a specified order
    - Each item's enclosing environemnt is the next item
* Search path &#8800; search list
    - Search path
        + Always starts from `.GlobalEnv`
        + Called with `search()`
    - Search list
        + Always starts from current environment
        + Called with `library(pryr); parenvs(all = TRUE)`
* The value of an object called by its name is searched along the search list
    - first in the current environment
    - second in the enclosing environment of the current ennvironment
    - third in the enclosing environment of the enclosing environment, and so on ...
* `library()` puts the package environment directly below `.GlobalEnv` and load the namespace of the package
* `attach()` let you attache any list/environment to the search path (at any position)
* `::` operator skips the search list and goes directly to the namespace of a certain environment
    - The package namespace will be loaded if it was not loaded before the call, but the package will not be attached to the search path.
    - `:::` operator let you access internal (private) objects of a namespace (at your own risk!)
    - If you do not know the namespace of the object you can use `getAnywhere()` to access internal and exported objects (public and private)



### Objects within the environment

* `ls()` stands for list. Lists all objects of a certain environment
    - Objects starting with a `.` are hidden. Use `all.names = TRUE` to show them
    - `ls.str()` lists all objects and applies `str()` to all objects
* `assign()`: create an object in a specific environment
    - `<-` creates an object in the current environment
    - `<<-` replaces existing object somewhere in the search list or if not existing defines it in `R_GlobalEnv`
* `exists()` returns boolean if an object with the specified name exists in the environment
* `get()` return the value of a named object
* `rm()` remove an object from a specified environment
* All those functions can be applied to a specific environment using the argument `pos`
    - By default `pos = -1L` which means current environment
    - By position in the search list: `pos = 1` means first entry in search path
    - By name: `pos = ".GlobalEnv"`
    - By a specific environment `pos = as.environment("package:base")`

```{r}
assign("x", 1:3, envir = .GlobalEnv) # same as x <- 1:3 but specific
ls()
get("x", ".GlobalEnv")
rm(list = ls()) ## removes all objects from current environment
```


* Determine framing environment of an object
    - There is no easy way to query an object for the environment that owns it.
    - It is possible that two or more environments own the same object.
    - One object name can refere to several objects (see `conflicts()`)
    - If you want to see the first environment in the search list containg an object with a certain name use `library(pryr); where("x")`
    - If you want to see all packages which contain a certain name use `find()`


## Environment of functions


```{r, collapse=TRUE}
p_env <- function() print(environment())
p_env() # returns function environment
environment(p_env) # returns environment property


age = 32 
MyFunction = function(){
  age = 22
  FromLocal = function() { print( age + 1 ) } 
  FromGlobal = function() { print( age + 1 ) } 
  NoSearch =  function() { age = 11; print( age + 1 ) } 
  environment( FromGlobal ) = .GlobalEnv
  
  FromLocal() 
  FromGlobal() 
  NoSearch()
} 
MyFunction()
```


Functions are related with three environments

1. Function environment
    * Every time R executes a function it creates a new local environment.
    * Variables (e.g. actual arguments) created inside that function will live inside that new environment
        - They will not overwrite variables by the same name outside the function's environment
    * When the function ends, the last value is returned and the environment is deleted
        - There is one exception: If the function environment is enclosing environment of a still existing function, it will **not** be deleted (see chapter \@ref(FunProgClosures)).
2. Framing environment
    * Where it is saved
    * Framing environment contiains function name and pointer to memory where function is stored
    * Determines if the function is found when it is called by name
3. Environment property
    * Where it should run
    * Environment property becomes enclosing environment of function environment (local environment created by calling the function)
    * Determines if the objects in the function are found
    * Get environment object with `environment(<function name>)`


By default:

- Framing environment = Environment property = Environment in which function was defined
- Can be changed with `environment<-` replacement function

(ref:EnvFun) The framing environment (green) is not necessarily the environment property of the function (blue). The Environment Property points to another environment and defines the search list of a function.

```{r EnvFun, echo = FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.align ='default', fig.show = 'hold', fig.cap='(ref:EnvFun)'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figures/env4_fun.png",
                          "figures/env5_fun.png"))
```


```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
**Search list &#8800; call stack**: the call stack is a list of hirarchical function calls where higher functions are executed within lower functions. This does not mean that the environment property of the higher function is the lower function.
```


```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
**Lexical scoping &#8800; dynamic scoping**: Lexical scoping means variables are searched where the function was defined, dynamic scoping means variables are searched where the function was called. R is closer to lexical scoping.
```



## Packages 
* Each package has 3 associated environements
    - Package environment
    - Namespace environment
    - Imports environment

### Package environment
Contains all exported (public) objects of the package (objects that the package author wants you to see)

### Namespace environment
Contains all objects of the package (public and private)

### Imports environment
Contains all objects from other packages that are explicitly stated requirements for a package to work properly. Packages which are imported by another package are listed in [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (see example of [ggplot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html)).


Advantage: Functions within a package always search for objects in the following order

1) Within the function environment
2) Within the package namespace
3) Within the namespace of imported packages
4) Within the base namespace
5) Along normal search path (`.GlobalEnv` &rarr; `package:base`)

If any package in the search path redefines any basic function (e.g. `+`), it will not affect the functions in the package as all objects used by the package are either imported or in the base namespace.


(ref:EnvMap) The environment property of a function in any package is the namespace of the package. The enclosing environment of namespace is imports:package. The environment property of the functions within imports:package is again the namespace of their package. Box: environment, Dotted arrows: environment property, solid arrows: enclosing environment

```{r EnvMap, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap='(ref:EnvMap)'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/env02_dotted.png")
```


(ref:EnvMap2) Map of the world. All search lists and environment properties in R.

```{r EnvMap2, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap='(ref:EnvMap2)'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/env03_map-of-the-world.png")
```


See how your current map of the world looks like (which package are attached, which namespaces are loaded)

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```



## Examples

### Example 1: pass object of class "acf" to `plot()`

1. Generic function (OOP)
    a) calls `UseMethod()` => determines class
    b) goes along search list to find `plot.acf()`
    c) finds it in environment `package:stats`
2. Function call
    a) function `plot.acf()` is called
    b) objects/functions within body of `plot.acf` are searched along search list
        - Search list: function environment &rarr; namespace:stats &rarr; imports:stats &rarr; namespace:base &rarr; R_GlobalEnv &rarr; ... &rarr; package:base
        - Example 1
            - In `plot.acf` there is the function `match.arg`
            - Will be found in namespace:base
        - Example 2
            - In `plot.acf` there is the function `par()`
            - Will be found in imports:stats because stats imports graphics
            - When `par()` is called a new environment is created with new search list (function environment &rarr; namespace:graphics &rarr; imports:graphics &rarr; namespace:base &rarr; R_GlobalEnv &rarr; ... &rarr; package:base)


### Example 2: Search list &#8800; call stack

```{r}
outer_fun <- function(x, y = 1) x + y
inner_fun <- function(x) x + y
y <- 2

outer_fun(inner_fun(1))
## inner function takes y from global.env NOT from outer_fun

outer_fun <- function(y){
  inner_var <- inner_fun(1)
  inner_var + y
}

outer_fun(100)
## Also here the inner function takes y from .GlobalEnv
## Note that two different y are used (once from .GlbalEnv and once from outer_fun function environment)
```


### Example 3: Change package function

Let's assume an auxiliary function in package

1. print it to console
2. copy&paste to *.R  script
3. "fix the bug"
4. "send to console" (evaluate in globalenv)
5. This is not sufficient

but rather you must additionally get it to have the correct "enclosing environment" with `environment(<thisFun>) <- asNamespace("pkgName")`
