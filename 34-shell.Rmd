# R from the shell

Mainly two commands

* `Rscript` (newer one, preferred)
* `R CMD BATCH` (old one)

Details see [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/218012917-How-to-run-R-scripts-from-the-command-line)


Execute single commands

```bash
Rscript -e "x <- rnorm(10); mean(x)"
```

Run R script

```bash
Rscript reto_script.R
```


Run R script and save image (workspace)

```bash
Rscript --save reto_script.R
```


Start running one script and continue working in the shell on another core

```bash
Rscript reto_script.R &
```


Write a shell script which does some tasks and runs R scripts. The following shell script:

- starts a for loop (from 1 to 4)
- prints the loop number (called `seed`)
- Runs `reto_script.R` with different seeds
- saves the output to the file `reto_script_loopnr.RData`
- the `&` runs differnt loop cicles on different cores in parallel. 

```bash
#!/bin/sh
for seed in 1 4 
do 
   echo $seed   
   Rscript -e "set.seed($seed); source('reto_script.R');save(a, file='reto_script_$seed.RData')" &
done
```


# Use R interactively in console (Linux)

Go to shell and type R, hit Enter. Opens up interactive console.


# Run Sweave from console

```bash
R CMD Sweave path/to/file.Rnw
```


# Extract R code from Rnw file

```bash
R CMD Stangle path/to/file.Rnw
```
