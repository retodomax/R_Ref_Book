# Data Import/Export


## Path to your file

* Absolute path
    - `read.csv("C:/Users/Reto/Downloads/myfile.csv")`
    - Not recomended, impossible to share between computers
* Relative path
    - `read.csv("Data/import/myfile.csv")`
    - `read.csv("../../Data/import/myfile.csv")`
        * Goes two levels up
    - Starts at you working directory
        * R project have fixed wd
        * `getwd()`, `setwd()`
        * Rmarkdown sets its working directory to the folder which contains the Rmd file (“working directory = directory where this file lives” even if you are in a Rproj!). Do not change working directory but use relative path (maybe with ../) to get to your files.
* Consider using package `here`
