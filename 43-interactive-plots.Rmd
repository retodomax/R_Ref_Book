# Interactive Plots

Overview of the R plot implementations [ggplot2 book](https://ggplot2-book.org/introduction.html#how-does-ggplot2-fit-in-with-other-r-graphics)

* HTML Widgets framework <http://www.htmlwidgets.org>
  - Do not need live R session
  - Interactivity comes from the client side (via JavaScript in the web browser)
  - many packages built on top of that (e.g. leaflet)
* plotly
  - javascript visualisation toolkit 
* Shiny framework
  - Easy but rely on a live R session
  - Interactivity from the provider (server with running R session)
